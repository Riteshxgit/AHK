# ⌨️Key remapper for better typing experience
except for pressing ctrl, shift, alt, and win key combos, you don't have to use any other key row than the three main key rows, i.e. the alphabet rows.
This is aimed to reduce the hand movement and improve touch typing experience by placing all the special symbols on the alphabet rows itself.
## 🟩installation (Windows only currently)
1. 💾install AHK form ahk website
2. 📥download all the files and then run them in order > FROM TOP TO BOTTOM

now you are good to go!!

## ❓How to Disable
the remappings can easily be toggled on and off from the widows task bar > show hidden icons(near the bottom right corner) > right click the hotkey icons and then disable or exit

- for re-enabling just run the files as mentioned previously
